# It-s-a-Thing

(Before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge that Ellie and Jay are the fucking MVPs for knowing how to program. Please take a moment to appreciate them, our two group brain cells.) 

TO-DO LIST

  Project goals: 

    -> Three NPCs, who can move and talk to each other, and can be switched between.
  
    -> A basic map (no rooms yet). 
    
   (This should give us a basic mechanical prototype to build off of.)
  
  
    -> Outline of setting/character plans. 
  
    -> Define future goals more clearly; from here, what needs to be done? 
  
    -> How many people want in? Bring your own what? (dialogue, sprites, character designs...?)
  
  (This should give us a better sense of what we're doing with the project itself.)
